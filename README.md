## Instructions
### Prerequisites
Clone the repo and run `yarn install`.

For each hole, your task is to conver the file called `hole` into the one called `target` in as few keystrokes as possible.


There is a command-line watcher available by running `yarn verify` with the name of the hole directory, e.g. `yarn verify hole1`. 

This requires the [`fswatch`](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch) program. It is available on `brew` or `port` for MacOS. and there are more installation instructions [here](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch).
