## Instructions
### Prerequisites
Clone the repo and run `yarn install`.

There are TODO holes on this course. 

Your task is to convert the file called `hole` into the one called `target` in as few keystrokes as possible.

If you are working with a partner, you may wish to install the [Presentation Assistant](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7345-presentation-assistant) IDE plugin to make it easier for them to see what you are doing.


There is a command-line watcher available by running `yarn verify` with the name of the hole directory, e.g. `yarn verify hole1`. 

This requires the [`fswatch`](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch) program. It is available on `brew` or `port` for MacOS. and there are more installation instructions [here](https://github.com/emcrisostomo/fswatch).
